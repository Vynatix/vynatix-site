# CLAUDE.md

This file orients Claude Code when working in this repository.

**Read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) first** — it is the primary, comprehensive guide
to this project (what it is, the layout, architecture, conventions, and how to
run and ship it). Everything there applies to Claude too. This file only
highlights the things most worth keeping front-of-mind.

## The short version

- **Static, hand-written marketing site** for Vynatix (a Nordic software
  consultancy). Nine pages. No framework, no build step, no package manager for
  the site — what's in the repo is what ships, served via GitHub Pages at
  `vynatix.com` (`CNAME`). `_config.yml` decides what is published; developer
  docs and `tools/` are excluded. `tools/` is the one npm-using exception and is
  local verification tooling only, never site content.
- **Built on the Vynatix Design System, three-layer CSS:** `tokens.css` (the
  system's generated tokens, read-only here except its `@font-face` block) and
  `colors_and_type.css` (the system's helpers and components, verbatim), then
  `styles.css` (the site's own layer). In `styles.css` use **role tokens only**
  (`var(--md-sys-color-primary)`, `var(--text-muted)`, `var(--space-6)`): no raw
  hex, no palette tokens, no `[data-theme]` selectors, so every rule holds in all
  six themes. **No inline `style=""`** — the CSP pins `style-src 'self'`.
- **Six themes, one drawn at random per visit.** `app.js` loads in the `<head>`
  (no `defer`, so there is no flash) and draws Forest, Teal or Monochrome once
  per visit, kept in `sessionStorage` (`vynatix-look`); light or dark follows the
  toggle (`localStorage`, `vynatix-theme`) or the system preference, and the
  toggle flips within the drawn direction. Blocked storage or no JS means
  Forest. The markup's `<html data-theme="light">` is the no-JS default. The
  inverse bands (CTA band, editorial band, footer) are light in the dark themes
  by design. Because the theme is random, any check that needs one pins it with
  `pinTheme` (`tools/verify/_common.js`), and a component change has to hold in
  all six (`THEMES=…` on the check scripts). Logo files, favicon, app icons and
  manifest colours stay Forest.
- **Header and footer (and the inline wordmark `<symbol>`) are duplicated
  across every `*.html` file** — there is no template/include system. Any nav,
  logo, footer, or contact-detail change must be made in **all** pages, and
  `aria-current="page"` set on the active link.
- **`app.js`** is vanilla, IIFE-per-feature, element-guarded — two features
  (theme draw and toggle, mobile nav) and no CDN/animation stack. Nothing on the site
  moves on its own: the system forbids auto-advancing strips and ambient loops.
  The CSP pins `script-src 'self'`, so adding any third-party script means
  widening the CSP in **all nine pages** first.
- **Icons are inline SVG** from the system's Material Symbols files in
  `assets/icons/` (`aria-hidden`, beside visible words or inside a labelled
  button). Never draw one, never use the `.ms` font classes.
- **Progressive enhancement and accessibility are load-bearing:** no-JS users
  get the final visible state, nothing hidden pending JS, and no control left
  dead. JS opts in by adding a class to `<html>` (`.js-nav` for the menu button,
  `.js-theme` for the theme toggle). Copy follows the system's content rules: no
  em dashes, no exclamation marks, sentence case. Don't regress any of this.

## Verifying work

There is no lint step, but there *is* a check suite: see `tools/README.md`
(`cd tools && npm install`, then `npm run check`). It covers broken links,
off-origin requests, CSP enforcement, accessibility including a contrast sweep,
and a screenshot diff. Serve the repo root first (`python3 -m http.server 8000`).

Also verify visually: render in light and dark, confirm header/footer match the
other pages, and check it degrades gracefully with JS disabled and reduced
motion on, with no console errors.

## Pushing

Pushing to the production branch publishes live to `vynatix.com`. Work only on
the assigned branch, and don't open a PR unless asked.
